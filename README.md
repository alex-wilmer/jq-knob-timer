# jq-knob-timer
A countdown timer using [aterrien/jQuery-Knob](https://github.com/aterrien/jQuery-Knob)

Dependencies:
    jQuery
    
    jQuery Knob  
    Font Awesome (but it doesn't really need to..)
  
If anyone sees this, I would be very interested in learning how to properly fork and extend the original plugin.

Thanks,
